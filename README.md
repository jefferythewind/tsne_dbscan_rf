# Data Segmentation via t-SNE, DBSCAN, and Random Forest

This is code which will re-create the MNIST experiment from my research paper available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13682

It is just an ipython notebook. The only non-standard pre-requisite is that you need to install the FIt-SNE available here: https://github.com/KlugerLab/FIt-SNE with accompanying paper here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0308-4. I am not sure, maybe I can just include their code in my repository here so it works "out-of-the-box".

The code takes a while to complete since it performs a 5-fold cross validation of the technique over the MNIST dataset.
